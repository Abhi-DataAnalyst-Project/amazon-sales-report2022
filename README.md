# amazon-sales-report2022

I’m excited to share my first excel project as a data analyst on Amazon annual sales report 2022.

I’m thrilled to announce the successful completion of my amazon annual sales dashboard using excel.

Objective: - Using my data analytics skill I got amazon sales data 2022 from amazon website and transform into excel to create a dashboard that provide valuable insights into the 2022 sales and make improve into 2023 sales.

Here are some of the topics covered:
Clean the data: In the data set there are some bank rows in all the column and some have Duplicate value in (courier, City, State column) so I clean the data to get valuable information from it & short the data type of Order date column.

Category wise total sales: I include category wise sales, this helps the business to get those categories which have more sales, that category more in stock for 2023. 

Total sales of Size of the category: I include size of the category wise sales. This helps the business to get those categories size which have more sales that size more in stock for 2023.

Top 5 state by sales: It help to targeting the states which have highest sales in 2022, that help to decide valuable decision for business grow in 2023.

Order status: By analyzing the order status I identify that some of orders are returned and some of pending and some shipped. This help the business to make informed decision that why some orders are returned, pending & shipped till now.

Monthly sales over the year 2022: By analyzing I identify that April & may got the highest no of sales and July to January have min sales. this helps the business to make valuable decision and announced some discount those months which have min sale compare to April and May.

Daily trend for total orders: I have also included a visualization that showcase the order volume on a daily basis. This helps the business to identify the pattern and make data-driven decision about inventory management.
